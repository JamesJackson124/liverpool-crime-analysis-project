# Visualisations Folder

This folder contains all **static plots and charts** generated during the Liverpool Crime Analysis Project.  
Plots were created in the **EDA** and **EDA2** notebooks and saved here as `.png` and `.pdf` files.

## Notes
- **These are the key visualisations**, but there may be additional exploratory plots saved in this folder that supported the analysis.  
- All plots use consistent **pastel colour palettes** and clear labelling for readability.  
- Filenames correspond to their chart names (e.g., `crime_type_distribution.png`).  
- Interactive plots and dashboards are not saved hereâ€”they remain in the notebooks.
